   If you have a Windows OS, use Docker Desktop by following these steps before continuing:

   1. Create a Docker account.
   2. Install Docker Desktop.
   3. In Docker Desktop: go to Add Extensions.
   4. Search for Jupyter Notebook Scientific Python Stack Extension and install it.
   5. Open newly installed extension.
   6. Open a terminal in the JupyterLab interface.

1. Clone Syndirella repo.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/kate-fie/syndirella.git
   cd syndirella

2. Open notebook at `syndirella/example/run_examples.ipynb` which will take you through installation,
looking at designs, running a handful of placements, and analysing outputs.
