Running an example
==================

This guide will walk you through an example to run Syndirella's pipeline through a jupyter notebook.

.. attention::

   If you have a Windows OS, use Docker Desktop by following these steps before continuing:

   1. Create a Docker account.
   2. Install Docker Desktop.
   3. In Docker Desktop: go to Add Extensions.
   4. Search for Jupyter Notebook Scientific Python Stack Extension and install it.
   5. Open newly installed extension.
   6. Open a terminal in the JupyterLab interface.

1. Clone Syndirella repo.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/kate-fie/syndirella.git
   cd syndirella

2. Open notebook at `syndirella/example/run_examples.ipynb <https://github.com/kate-fie/syndirella/blob/fc9c087c6ee276b404a7a226d1a076ed12e3e6a0/example/run_examples.ipynb>`_ which will take you through installation,
looking at designs, running a handful of placements, and analysing outputs.
