Installation
============

**Using Conda**

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/kate-fie/syndirella.git
       conda env create -f environment.yml
       conda activate syndirella
       # install pyrosetta, need signin info, replace ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾:ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ with your info
       conda install -c https://ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾:ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾@west.rosettacommons.org/pyrosetta/conda/release pyrosetta

You need a Rosetta license to install PyRosetta. You can find more information `here <https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download>`_.

**Using the Makefile** NOT RECOMMENDED

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/kate-fie/syndirella.git
       cd syndirella
       make

Setting Up
==========

Once you have installed Syndirella, follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Setting environment variables**:
-------------------------------------
   .. code-block:: bash

       export SYNDIRELLA_BASE_PATH=/path/to/syndirella
       export MANIFOLD_API_KEY=[API_KEY]

You need to have a Manifold account and an API key to use Syndirella. You can find more information `here <https://api.postera.ai/api/v1/docs/>`_.

2. **Configuration of reaction constants** (if applicable):
-----------------------------------------------------------
**Reactions**:
Syndirella has 20 encoded reactions which you can find in `syndirella/constants/RXN_SMARTS_CONSTANTS.json`. You can edit this file to add more reactions to your liking.

**Alternative Reactions**:
You can provide alternative reactions to your preference if they are easier or more successful. Add them in `syndirella/constants/ADDITIONAL_RXN_OPTIONS.json`.

**Alternative Reactants**:
If there are reactants for certain reactions that you prefer to use, you can add them in `syndirella/constants/RXN_SMARTS_CONSTANTS.json`.

Basic Usage
===========

Elaborate a set of base compounds using these steps:

1. **Create CSV of Base Compounds**:
------------------------------------
    The input CSV must contain base_compound SMILES and fragment hits names exactly how they appear in the SDF. You can either choose to run the pipeline with manual or automatic route finding.

    **Manual Routes**:
    You can select the exact route to elaborate the base_compound with the reaction names, exact reactants, and number of steps in the route. An example template is at `syndirella/syndirella_input_template_manual.csv`.

    **Automatic Routes**:
    Base compounds can be elaborated by routes automatically proposed by Manifold. All you need in the CSV is the base_compound SMILES and hits names. An example template is at `syndirella/syndirella_input_template.csv`.

2. **Download protein structures and fragment hits from Fragalysis**:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Go to `Fragalysis <https://fragalysis.xchem.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/landing>`_ and download a dataset.

3. **Optional: Relax protein template**:
----------------------------------------
    Choose the holo protein template you would like to run placements with and relax with PyRosetta.

    Manually check fragment hits are where you are expecting them!

4. **Run pipeline**:
--------------------

Run as pip installed tool.

**Manual Routes**:
    .. code-block:: bash

        conda activate syndirella
        python pipeline --manual_route --input_csv /path/to/input_csv --output_dir /path/to/output_dir --template /path/to/template.pdb --hits /path/to/hits.sdf

**Automatic Routes**:
    .. code-block:: bash

        conda activate syndirella
        python pipeline --input_csv /path/to/input_csv --output_dir /path/to/output_dir --template /path/to/template.pdb --hits /path/to/hits.sdf
